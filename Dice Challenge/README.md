#Dice Challenge
  For this challenge, I had to write the JavaScript functions for a dice game where highest number wins. The game can be restarted simply by refreshing the page. I coded the "roll" of the dice , the changing of the images and deciding the who the winner is with a banner. This challenge built on my JavaScript syntax.
